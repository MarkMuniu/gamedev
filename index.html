    <h1>Game Development</h1>
  </div>  
    <p>Hi! My name is Mark Muniu and I will be talking about the game development and it's future from myb point of view in this website.</p>

    <p>Video games have existed for a very long time now and they have evolved tremendously over the years from 2D arcade games to 3D ultra-realistic and also futuristic games. All this being able to be achieved through individuals exploring their imaginations in some of the wildest, creative and unique ways; Each generation of developers acting as pacesetters and also paving the way for the next generation. This has led to a vast pool of games in different genres that could never really be fully exploited, allowing room for more creative game ideas to be brought to life on screen.</p>

    <h2>Its Relevance</h2>
    <p>Aside from the obvious "creating employment", the game dev industry also gives a chance to most people to be able to explore beyond limits of the average human by relating to characters with extra-ordinary abilities and being given the chance to experience the game from their point of view. There are also games which are mainly disigned to challenge the player through puzzles and problems that help develop problem solving skills.</p>

    <h2>Its Downside</h2>
    <p>Many people may argue that certain games are too extreme and that they may cause people to develop negative or unacceptable behaviours due to their content. I personally think that this may not be accurate because if an individual could be easily swayed due to playing the video games then it wouldn't be any harder for other experiences or encounters in life to do the same and so the only thing that game developers can do is to issue out clear warnings to the public about the content inside the game if and where necessary</p>

    <h2>Its Future</h2>
    <p>Game Development is increasing its application in other sectors and industries in that game developers can create real life simulations in order to decrease the risk of getting hurt during work.</p>
